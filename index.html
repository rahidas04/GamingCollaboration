        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I'm sure that you've heard some rendition of this phrase before:
          "Video games are a distraction, and a waste of time. Why would you
          play something so isolating?" But what if that idea is completely
          wrong?
        </p>
        <p>
          In reality, modern games are some of the most powerful tools for
          connection, community, and collaboration. These games are places where
          you can form friendships and grow communities right from the comfort
          of your own desk! Whether you're coordinating with teammates in a
          fast-paced match, building peaceful farms together, or chatting in a
          livestream, modern gaming is far from isolating.

          This website is not just for gamers though; It's for everyone!
          Whethere you've been playing video games your entire life or someone
          who is just curious, you won't be bored with this website! If you're
          ever wondered why games matter so much to people, you are in the right
          place!
        </p>
        <p>Here, you'll explore four major types of gaming experiences:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Multiplayer Competitive Games</strong> – Where teamwork,
            strategy, and fast decisions build trust and cooperation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Open-World Roleplaying Games</strong> – Expansive virtual
            worlds that invite shared discovery and storytelling.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Narrative Games</strong> – Solo games that spark deep
            emotional responses and cultural conversations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Streaming & Creator Culture</strong> – How communities form
            around watching, not just playing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So why stay and explore the website? I want to help change the
          narrative around video games to show how it's actually a place that
          breeds community and helps people feel a little more human and a
          little less alone.
        </p>

          Scroll on, explore the sections, and see how today’s games are quietly
          reshaping what community looks like.
